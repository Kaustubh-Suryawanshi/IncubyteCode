## Overview
The Galactic SpaceCraft is a C++ program designed to simulate the movement of a spacecraft in a three-dimensional space. It allows users to control the spacecraft's position and orientation using a series of simple commands.
## Features
    1. Move the spacecraft forward and backward in three dimensions (x, y, z).
    2. Rotate the spacecraft 90 degrees to the left or right.
    3. Turn the spacecraft upward or downward.
    4. Execute a sequence of commands to navigate the spacecraft.

    The program will execute a predefined sequence of commands ('f', 'r', 'u', 'b', 'l') and then display the final position and direction of the spacecraft.   
## Commands
    f: Move forward one step.

    b: Move backward one step.

    l: Turn left (rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise).

    r: Turn right (rotate 90 degrees clockwise).

    u: Turn upward (change direction to 'U').

    d: Turn downward (change direction to 'D').
